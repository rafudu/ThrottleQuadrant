# Throttle quadrant using arduino

Code for implementing a simple Throttle / Prop / Mixture quadrant using arduino.

This code is based on the [Arduino Joystick Library](https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary) and it's only compatible with 'an Arduino Leonardo or Arduino Micro (or any Arduino clone that is based on the ATmega32u4)'. Check their repo for more details.
